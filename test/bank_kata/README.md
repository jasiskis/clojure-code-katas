# Bank Kata

Think of your personal bank account experience. When in doubt, go for the simplest solution.

## Requirements:

- Deposit and Withdrawal
- Account statement printing (see below)

Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When they print their bank statement
Then they would see:

Date,Credit,Debit,Balance
14/01/2012,,500,2500
13/01/2012,2000,,3000
10/01/2012,1000,,1000
